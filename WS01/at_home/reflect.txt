This workshop helped me a lot because I was able to apply the concepts that I
learned in class specially regarding modularity. I learned how modularity works
by diving the program into small parts and linking the modules together. This
workshop helped understand the concept of Object-Oriented programming.

In doing this workshop, I learned that the purpose of using namespaces is to
avoid variable naming conflict in the program. Also, I learned that header
files are for defining classes and declaring function prototypes. Functions
should not be defined in a header file because functions are defined in an
implementation file.

Header files should not be compiled because there is no need to compile them.
Header files are usually included in implementation/source files, which are the
actual files intended to be compiled. A header file usually is only for
declaring function prototypes and/or defining classes.

An implementation file or .cpp file should never be included in another source
file because this will cause a few LINK errors in the program as I have
encountered while doing this workshop. The error is caused by the compiler
detecting multiple declarations in the program because I mistakenly included a
.cpp to another .cpp file, but I corrected it and the program worked.
