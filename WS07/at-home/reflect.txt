The Hero class does not need to know the existence of the SuperHero class because the
SuperHero class "is-a" Hero but a Hero is not necessarily a SuperHero.

The SuperHero class need to know about the existence of the Hero class because its
parent class is the Hero class and it needs to access some of the methods of the Hero
class.

It printed out "Ancient Battle!" because when a SuperHero fights a Hero, they are not
allowed to use the Super (bonus) power. Therefore, a fight between a SuperHero and a
Hero is identical to the fight between Heroes, so the SuperHero class calls that
function from the Hero class.
