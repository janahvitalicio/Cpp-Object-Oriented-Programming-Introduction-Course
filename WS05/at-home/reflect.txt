In this workshop, I learned how to overload member operators and to use them for different
purposes. In general, the workshop was manageable and the instructions were straightforward.

The operator+ should not return a reference to a Fraction object (like operator+=) because
this operator was overloaded after returning its value. Therefore, we only need to return a
copy of the current object as it was before any changes took place.

Four temporary objects were created in this program: Before the display of Fraction a, after
the display of Fraction b, when a and b were added together, and when b and d were added
together.

I reused the function isEmpty a lot to avoid duplication. Also, instead of using if/else-if
statement, I turned it into a Boolean expression to lessen the line of codes.
